# ADF_Pipelines
2 ADF Pipelines have been created.
1. (Blob to ADF to SQL server) and the various connection issues encountered.
2. Fetching data from 2 sources (blob & adls) using join in ADF Datadflow to SQL server.
3. Fetching data from On-Prem (local Postgre Server) to Azure SQL server - still encountering some firewall issue, yet to be able to read data on Azure SQL server - WIP
